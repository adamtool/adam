  pnwt2dot                       Converts a Petri net with transits in APT format to a dot
                                 file.
  pnwt2pdf                       Converts a Petri net with transits in APT format to a pdf
                                 file by using Graphviz (dot has to be executable).
  mc                             Modelchecking Flow-LTL on Petri nets with flows or LTL on
                                 safe Petri nets with inhibitor arcs.
  sdn_mc                         Modelchecking Software Defined Networks.
  benchCAV2019                   Just for benchmark purposes. Model checks nets and formulas
                                 for CAV 2019.
  export                         Exports some data from the tool.
  gen_mc_rm_node_update          Generates a network which has a update function to detour
                                 exactly one node (the node is chosen randomly). Saves the
                                 resulting net in APT and, if dot is executable, as pdf.
  gen_mc_redundant_flow_network  Generates a network which has to ways to the output. A update
                                 function can block one of the ways. This can be done in
                                 correct or incorrect ways. Saves the resulting net in APT
                                 and, if dot is executable, as pdf.
  gen_topologie_zoo              Generates a network from the topology given by the input
                                 file. Saves the resulting net in APT and, if dot is
                                 executable, as pdf.
  gen_mc_smart_factory           Generates a smart factory which can create 'nb_products'
                                 products. There
                                 are 'nb_shared_machines' machines which are shared by all
                                 products, and
                                 'nb_special_machines' machines which are just responsable for
                                 the
                                 creation of one type of product. Saves the resulting net in
                                 APT and, if dot is executable, as pdf.
