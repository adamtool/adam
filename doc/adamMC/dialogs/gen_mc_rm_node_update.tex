usage: sh adam.sh gen_mc_rm_node_update [-con] [-d] [-l <file>] -nb1 <numberOf_nodes> [-npdf]
       -o <file> [-psst] [-v]
Generates a network which has a update function to detour exactly one node (the node is chosen
randomly). Saves the resulting net in APT and, if dot is executable, as pdf.
 -con,--connectivity                Adds the formula checking connectivity to the net
                                    inscription.
 -d,--debug                         Get some debug infos.
 -l,--logger <file>                 The path to an optional logger file. If it's not set, the
                                    information will be send to the terminal.
 -nb1,--nb_nodes <numberOf_nodes>   The desired number of node (>= 3).
 -npdf,--noPDF                      Does not create a pdf of the generated net.
 -o,--output <file>                 The output path where the generated Petri net with flows
                                    should be saved.
 -psst,--silent                     Makes the tool voiceless.
 -v,--verbose                       Makes the tool chatty.
